# Work-Day-Scheduler
## Purpose
This was challenge was meant to give the user the ability to keep track of their day. The app would allow the user to create, edit, save, and delete tasks to their schedule. I had a really tough time with this challenge as moment.js and jquery was a little hard for me to understand this time around. I'll definitely have to review this module again later.
